# TrafficEnvironmentImpactForecast - Building Smart Environment using FIWARE Smart City Platform

### Forecast the Impact of Carbon Footprint on the Environment from co2 Emission historically
In the globalizing world, many factors such as rapidly increasing population, production and consumption habits, and economic growth cause climate changes. The carbon footprint is a measure of CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere, which increases day by day, causing glaciers to melt and increase sea level, reduce water resources, and global warming. For this reason, in this project it is aimed to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions and to determine its damages to the economy by applying the time-series forecasting algorithm across the sample dataset derived from the example data/payload containing the variables of area/locality, location coordinates, vehicle speed and the number of vehicles in the traffic at a given period of time in a day historically for less than 3 years.

Currently, we have just plotted a graph with MatPlot Lib in Python, practically, we are thinking of using a "No Code Machine Learning" Software (java-based) named *WEKA* offered by University of Waikato. Eventually, we can advance this solution with detailed data analytics using Python Libraries.
